        Welcome to the Hardin County Armory, Ohio's oldest and most unique National Guard Armory.  
        We are a non-profit foundation made up of volunteers who saw the benefit in saving this unique structure.  
        We now operate the Armory as a reception site.  It is a beautiful location for your next event, 
        and we know you will agree.
