          <p>The Hardin County Armory was built in 1894 as a county guard armory. At the time, the adjutant general lived in Kenton, and built the armory with a grand ballroom and sauna.</p>
        </div>
        <div className={classes.rowReverse}>
          <p>In 1947, the building was partially destroyed by a fire.  Reports claimed the fire began in the basement by a guardsman cleaning rifles.</p>

        <div className={classes.row}>
          <img src={castleImg} alt='basketball'/>
          <p>The building also served as a gymnasium for the city schools, and on weekends it hosted college basketball and Golden Gloves boxing.</p>
        </div>
        <div className={classes.rowReverse}>
          <p>The Hardin County Armory remained in use until 1991, when it was abandoned and stood empty and decaying.</p>

        <div className={classes.row}>
          <img src={armoryImg} alt='castle'/>
          <p>After attempts by the city, county, and private citizens to tear it down, a group of concerned citizens stepped in to save the building. Now a non-profit foundation, they have worked since 1997 to renovate the building.</p>

        <div className={classes.rowReverse}>
          <p>Today this building is revered by lovers of history, as well as brides looking for the perfect reception site. The Armoryâ€™s charm is its history, which includes an exposed brick wall left from the fire in 1947, as well as its castle-like facade.</p>
